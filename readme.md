## Docker Dev Environments

I just tested this repo in Docker Desktop app in Windows. Below couple remarks required to succesfuly run the app from such VC code setup.

After opening the project in Visual Studio Code we have to open terminal and update the current linux distro.

```sudo apt update```

```sudo apt upgrade```

Next install

```sudo apt-get install python3-venv```

After those steps are completed we should be aable to proceed and setup venv.

Next step after virtual environment is to install pip requirements. This one is failing in that docker setup.
Package named ```multidict``` is failing to build with below message:
```Failed building wheel for multidict```

Details:
```Command "/com.docker.devenvironments.code/venv/bin/python -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/tmp/pip-install-7r92pke8/multidict/setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /tmp/pip-record-9ifrw1lh/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /com.docker.devenvironments.code/venv/include/site/python3.7/multidict" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-install-7r92pke8/multidict/```

I will verify later what is needed to fix this one.
